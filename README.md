# FB2MKTP - Facebook ‚û°Ô∏è Marketplace

<br>

What can this tool do?:
- By pasting the target's Facebook profile URL, this tool takes you directly to the target's Marketplace account
- It provides you with the target's Facebook user ID
- You can also paste a few Facebook URLs (leave a space in between each facebook url) at the same time

# üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Errors
